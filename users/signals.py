"""
In Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:

*args (Non Keyword Arguments)
**kwargs (Keyword Arguments)


We use *args and **kwargs as an argument when we are unsure about the number of arguments to pass in the functions.
